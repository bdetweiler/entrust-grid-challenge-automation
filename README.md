# Entrust Grid Challenge Automation

Some websites use a two-factor authentication that is more frustrating than a small child kicking the back of your seat on an airplane. Having to locate a grid mapping each and every time you login is just awful. Fortunately, we can use [AutoHotKey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) to get around this terrible, horrible, no-good security hurdle. 

For the record, I support 2FA. But in order for it to be effective, it needs to be easy to use. A text or email code is a better choice.
